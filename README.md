A Bukkit plugin that transforms Minecraft into an RPG without feeling too disconnected from the core game.
There is no included *storyline* and the purpose of this plugin is to provide server owners and creators
the tools necessary to create immersive storylines and unique experiences for players.

The initial intention of this plugin is to almost overhaul Minecraft's serverside and rework the game starting
with simple modifications and working towards deep parts of the engine while maintaining the feel of the original game,
*effectively reworking the game as if it was built with RPG storylines in mind.*
